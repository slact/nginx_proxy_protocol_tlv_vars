# nginx_proxy_protocol_tlv_vars

Add support for [Proxy Protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) v2 TLV parsing to variables for `http` and `stream` modules.

Nginx released PPv2 support in version 1.15.2, however, they kept TLV parsing limited to the nonfree [Nginx Plus](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-plus-r16-released/#r16-ppv2-privatelink) package. This patch brings that stuff for open source Nginx users.

## Applying Patch

```bash
VERSION=1.16.0 #nginx version to patch
#grab nginx
wget http://nginx.org/download/nginx-$VERSION.tar.gz
tar -xzf nginx-$VERSION.tar.gz
cd nginx-$VERSION/
#grab patch
wget https://github.com/slact/nginx_proxy_protocol_tlv_vars/raw/master/nginx-$VERSION-proxy_protocol_vars.patch
#apply patch
patch -p1 < nginx-$VERSION-proxy_protocol_vars.patch

#now build nginx as you normally would
./configure ...
make
make install
```

## Usage

This patch adds the following variables when using `listen proxy_protocol`:

#### `$proxy_protocol_tlv_0xXX`
  the TLV value with type code `0xXX`, where `XX` is a 2-digit hex value `00` - `FF`.
  ```nginx
  add_header X-pp-tlv-0xEC $proxy_protocol_tlv_0xEC;
  ```

#### `$proxy_protocol_tlv_AWS_VPCE_ID` (parsed from type `0xEA`)
  Amazon's AWS [VPC Endpoint ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-target-groups.html#custom-tlv). This is the equivalent of [Nginx Plus](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-plus-r16-released/#r16-ppv2-privatelink)' `$proxy_protocol_tlv_0xEA`.
  ```nginx
  add_header X-aws-vpce-id $proxy_protocol_tlv_AWS_VPCE_ID; #vpce-08d2bf15fac5001c9
  ```

#### `$proxy_protocol_tlv_ALPN` (type `0x01`)
  > Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN). It is a byte sequence defining
  > the upper layer protocol in use over the connection. The most common use case
  > will be to pass the exact copy of the ALPN extension of the Transport Layer
  > Security (TLS) protocol as defined by RFC7301.

#### `$proxy_protocol_tlv_AUTHORITY` (type `0x02`)
  > Contains the host name value passed by the client, as an UTF8-encoded string.
  > In case of TLS being used on the client connection, this is the exact copy of
  > the "server_name" extension as defined by RFC3546 [10], section 3.1, often
  > referred to as "SNI". There are probably other situations where an authority
  > can be mentionned on a connection without TLS being involved at all.
  
#### `$proxy_protocol_tlv_CRC32C` (type `0x03`)
  > The value of the type PP2_TYPE_CRC32C is a 32-bit number storing the CRC32c
  > checksum of the PROXY protocol header.

#### `$proxy_protocol_tlv_NETNS` (type `0x30`)
  > The type PP2_TYPE_NETNS defines the value as the US-ASCII string representation
  > of the namespace's name.

## Caveats

- When using SSL, Nginx limits the length of the entire Proxy Protocol header message to 108 bytes. Larger headers will be dropped. Although this limit is trivial to increase, I have chosen not to do so out of performance considerations. 

- Unlike Nginx Plus, this patch does not parse Amazon's VPC Endpoint ID into `$proxy_protocol_tlv_0xEA`, but uses `$proxy_protocol_tlv_AWS_VPCE_ID` instead. `$proxy_protocol_tlv_0xEA` retains its initial raw value, which Amazon made `"\0x01<vpce_id>"` for some reason.

- As required by the [Proxy Protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) spec, a PPv2 header message with a bad `CRC32C` checksum TLV is discarded as invalid. This applies to all `$proxy_protocol_*` variables, including `$proxy_protocol_addr` and `$proxy_protocol_port`.

- As required by the [Proxy Protocol](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt) spec, the `0x04` (No-op) TLV type is ignored.

## Prebuilt packages for CentOS/RHEL 6, 7

Prebuilt CentOS/RHEL package of stable NGINX including the patch can be found [here](https://www.getpagespeed.com/nginx-mod-a-better-faster-nginx-build). To install NGINX with the patch, run:

    yum -y install https://extras.getpagespeed.com/release-el$(rpm -E %{rhel})-latest.rpm
    yum -y install yum-utils
    yum-config-manager --enable getpagespeed-extras-nginx-mod
    yum install nginx
